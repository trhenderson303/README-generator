## Description

This README generator command line application functions in the user's terminal or git command line. It uses the inquirer npm to provide a series of questions to users about their project. Then, the application will take the user's input and write a professional README.md file that can be seamlessly incorporated into a github repository, or anywhere else a README file may be needed.
